/**
 * Tests for inline-flow / inline-agent dispatch via `session/start`.
 *
 * Verifies that the RPC handler accepts:
 *   - A literal flow object (`flow: { stages: [...] }`)
 *   - A literal agent object on stage.agent (`{ runtime, model, system_prompt }`)
 *
 * The handler persists the inline flow under `session.config.inline_flow`
 * and registers it on the ephemeral flow overlay under `inline-<sessionId>`
 * so subsequent stage lookups resolve through the overlay. Dispatch is not
 * exercised end-to-end -- we just assert the session was created and the
 * ephemeral overlay now carries the flow.
