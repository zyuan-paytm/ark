/**
 * Firecracker availability probe.
 *
 * Firecracker has hard platform requirements:
 *   - Linux kernel 4.14+ (we only check `platform() === "linux"`; kernel
 *     version checks are brittle and the binary itself will fail cleanly
 *     if the host is too old).
 *   - `/dev/kvm` present and readable by the current user. On most distros
 *     this means the user is in the `kvm` group. The file existing but not
 *     being readable is a common foot-gun, so we explicitly check access().
 *   - `firecracker` binary on PATH (or at the default Firecracker release
 *     location; we only check PATH here -- callers can pass an absolute
 *     binary path via FirecrackerVmSpec in the future).
 *   - `ip` from iproute2 for TAP/bridge setup. Busybox `ip` is acceptable
 *     but unusual; we only verify the command resolves.
 *
 * This function is explicitly non-throwing. Callers (FirecrackerCompute, or
 * the CLI probe command) need to make scheduling decisions based on the
 * result -- on macOS for example we fall back to Docker, not crash.
