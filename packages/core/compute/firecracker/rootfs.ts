/**
 * Firecracker kernel + rootfs acquisition.
 *
 * Responsibility split (see `.workflow/plan/compute-runtime-vision.md`):
 *
 *   - `paths.ts` owns the ON-DISK LAYOUT (content-addressed under
 *     `~/.ark/firecracker/`), but NOT how the artifacts got there.
 *   - `rootfs.ts` (this file) owns HOW the artifacts get there. On first use
 *     it downloads a prebuilt kernel + rootfs from a well-known URL, verifies
 *     a pinned sha256, and returns the content-addressed paths. Subsequent
 *     calls are a cheap "is the file present?" check.
 *   - `vm.ts` then consumes those paths verbatim.
 *
 * ## Rootfs expectations
 *
 * The rootfs we ship must boot to a point where an agent can:
 *   - Listen on :19300 with arkd (host reaches it via the TAP /30 peer IP).
 *   - Expose /snapshot and /launch endpoints exactly the way the localhost
 *     arkd does.
 *
 * For the first-cut (this PR) we take a minimalist bootstrap approach:
 *
 *   1. Ship an Alpine ext4 rootfs small enough (~60 MiB) to keep test cycles
 *      tolerable. Alpine is friendly to "install bun on first boot" because
 *      apk is fast and the musl toolchain is compatible with bun's glibc
 *      binaries via the `libc6-compat` / `gcompat` shim packages.
 *   2. At image-bake time (ahead of landing this PR) the rootfs has a tiny
 *      `/etc/local.d/arkd-init.start` OpenRC service (Alpine's equivalent of
 *      rc.local) that:
 *        a. If `/usr/local/bin/bun` is missing, curls the bun installer and
 *           installs bun into /usr/local. First boot: ~15s.
 *        b. Clones `/opt/ark` from a block-device mount if present (a
 *           follow-up turns this into a 9p / virtio-fs share; today we bake
 *           arkd into the image for speed). Missing -> assume baked.
 *        c. Starts arkd on :19300 bound to 0.0.0.0.
 *   3. TODO(phase-2b): replace the baked-rootfs download with a "build from
 *      Dockerfile" path (OCI image -> ext4 via `docker export | mksquashfs`
 *      or `virt-make-fs`). The Dockerfile lives in `.infra/firecracker/` and
 *      parametrises bun version + arkd source ref. First-cut hard-codes the
 *      URL + sha below.
 *   4. TODO(phase-2c): generate a `firstboot` marker in the rootfs so that
 *      subsequent boots short-circuit the bun install path.
 *
 * ## Known limitations (first cut)
 *
 *   - We do NOT hash the full rootfs ourselves -- we trust the URL publisher.
 *     The sha256 constant below is the release pinning; if the URL's content
 *     drifts we fail the verify step. Callers who need stronger supply-chain
 *     guarantees can override via `ARK_FC_ROOTFS_URL` + `ARK_FC_ROOTFS_SHA256`
 *     (plus the KERNEL equivalents). The env vars are intentionally
 *     undocumented in the CLI -- they're an escape hatch, not a supported
 *     feature.
 *   - First boot is slow (bun install over the network). A follow-up bakes
 *     bun into the rootfs.
 *   - The rootfs has no persistent state. Each provision starts from the
 *     base image; a diff drive lands with snapshots.
 *   - No retry on download failure. One-shot; caller re-runs `provision` to
 *     retry.
