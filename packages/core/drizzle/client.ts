/**
 * Drizzle client construction. Returns a dialect-bound handle that repositories
 * can use in place of raw `db.prepare(...).run(...)`.
 *
 * Status (phase A of the drizzle cutover): the handle is exposed via
 * `AppContext.drizzle` for incremental adoption. Repositories still use the
 * hand-rolled SQL path for the moment; see DRIZZLE_CUTOVER_STATUS for the
 * sequencing of the per-repo rewrites.
 *
 * Both drivers reuse the SAME underlying clients the existing `DatabaseAdapter`
 * adapters already own:
 *   - SQLite: the `bun:sqlite` `Database` instance
 *   - Postgres: the `postgres.js` client created by `PostgresAdapter`
 * so there is no duplicate connection pool.

// Both the type alias and the runtime call go through `any` here; the
// runtime adapter is only constructed in `app.ts`'s SQLite branch (Bun
// only), so the type leakage never hits Node.
