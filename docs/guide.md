# Ark User Guide

Ark is an autonomous agent ecosystem. It orchestrates AI coding agents through DAG-based SDLC flows on top of 11 compute providers, with a unified knowledge graph, an LLM router, universal cost tracking, and a multi-tenant control plane.

This guide covers every user-visible concept. Start at the top for the 60-second quickstart, then dive into whichever section you need.

## 1. Quickstart

Sixty seconds from zero to a running agent.

```bash
# 1. Install (tarball -- recommended)
curl -fsSL https://ytarasova.github.io/ark/install.sh | bash

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/ytarasova/ark.git
cd ark
make install          # requires Bun + tmux pre-installed

# 2. Verify
ark doctor            # check prerequisites (bun, tmux, git, gh, claude)
ark --version
ark agent list        # shows 13 builtin agents
ark flow list         # shows 14 builtin flows

# 3. Start a session from a recipe and dispatch it
ark session start \
  --recipe quick-fix \
  --repo . \
  --summary "Add a README badge for build status" \
  --dispatch

# 4. Watch it work
ark web               # web dashboard (or launch the Electron desktop app)
# or
ark session list
ark session events <sessionId>
```

You now have:

- a git worktree at `~/.ark/worktrees/<sessionId>/`
- a tmux session (`ark-s-<id>`) running Claude Code inside it
- an MCP channel, knowledge context injected into the prompt, and hook-based status reporting
- events streaming to the CLI and Web dashboards

Requirements: tmux, git, and (for auto-PR) the `gh` CLI. The tarball install bundles everything else. If installing from source, you also need [Bun](https://bun.sh). Ark is bun-only -- it uses `bun:sqlite`, `Bun.serve`, and Bun FFI.

You can also install the [Ark Desktop app](packages/desktop/INSTALL.md) for a native window experience (macOS, Windows, Linux).

## 2. Sessions

A session is the unit of work in Ark. Each session has a repo, a summary, an agent or flow, a compute target, a git worktree, and a lifecycle.

### Lifecycle operations

| Command                      | What it does                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ark session start`          | Creates the session row and worktree. Does not launch the agent. |
| `ark session dispatch <id>`  | Launches the agent executor in tmux (or remote via arkd).        |
| `ark session advance <id>`   | Moves a flow to the next stage.                                  |
| `ark session complete <id>`  | Marks stage/session complete. Runs verify gates.                 |
| `ark session pause <id>`     | Pauses a running session.                                        |
| `ark session resume <id>`    | Resumes a paused session.                                        |
| `ark session stop <id>`      | Kills the tmux session and cleans hooks.                         |
| `ark session fork <id>`      | Spawns N child sessions from a parent (fan-out).                 |
| `ark session clone <id>`     | Duplicates a session with the same config.                       |
| `ark session handoff <id>`   | Transfers control to another agent/runtime.                      |
| `ark session archive <id>`   | Hides from default list without deleting.                        |
| `ark session delete <id>`    | Removes session, worktree, and events.                           |
| `ark session interrupt <id>` | Sends Ctrl+C to the running agent (tmux stays up).               |

Sessions use a `status` field with states: `pending`, `ready`, `running`, `waiting`, `stopped`, `blocked`, `completed`, `failed`, `archived`.

### Start and dispatch examples

```bash
# One-shot: start + dispatch in a single command
ark session start \
  --repo . \
  --summary "Fix flaky test in session.test.ts" \
  --agent implementer \
  --flow quick \
  --dispatch

# Start first, configure, then dispatch
ark session start --repo . --summary "Add auth middleware"
ark session update <id> --agent implementer --compute docker
ark session dispatch <id>

# Start on a specific runtime (override the agent default)
ark session start --repo . --summary "Refactor router" \
  --agent implementer --runtime codex --dispatch

# Start from a recipe
ark session start --recipe feature-build --repo . --dispatch
```

### Flow control

```bash
# Advance to next stage (manual gate)
ark session advance <id>

# Mark stage complete (runs verify gates)
ark session complete <id>

# Force complete (skip verify -- use sparingly)
ark session complete <id> --force

# Run verify gates without completing
ark session verify <id>

# Add a human todo that must be checked before completion
ark session todo add <id> "Update the CHANGELOG"
ark session todo list <id>
```

### Fan-out and children

Fan-out decomposes a task into N parallel child sessions. The parent waits for all children to complete.

```bash
ark session fork <parentId> --count 4 --summaries "feature A,feature B,feature C,feature D"
ark session join <parentId>     # block until children finish
```

The `fan-out` and `dag-parallel` builtin flows are wired for this pattern. Parent auto-joins when the last child hits `completed`.

### Session replay

After a session completes, you can replay its timeline event-by-event. Replay builds a step-by-step view with elapsed timestamps, stage transitions, and human-readable summaries.

The web dashboard surfaces this as a visual timeline. Programmatically, the `session.replay` JSON-RPC method returns an array of `ReplayStep` objects (index, timestamp, elapsed, type, stage, actor, summary, detail).

### Interrupt, archive, delete

```bash
ark session interrupt <id>      # Ctrl+C into the agent, keep tmux alive
ark session archive <id>        # hide from `list`
ark session archive <id> --restore
ark session delete <id>         # hard delete (worktree + rows)
```

---

## 3. Flows

A flow is a DAG of stages. Each stage has an agent, a gate type, optional verify scripts, and optional dependencies. Flows live in `flows/definitions/*.yaml` and follow the same three-tier resolution as other resources (builtin, `~/.ark/flows/`, `.ark/flows/`).

### Builtin flows (14)

| Name              | Purpose                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bare`            | Single stage -- just run one agent.                                            |
| `quick`           | Plan plus implement, no review.                                                |
| `default`         | Plan, audit, implement, verify, review, document, close.                       |
| `autonomous`      | Single agent, fully autonomous, auto-completes on agent report.                |
| `autonomous-sdlc` | Plan -> implement -> verify -> review -> PR -> merge. All auto gates.          |
| `parallel`        | Independent stages that run in parallel.                                       |
| `fan-out`         | Parent dispatches N child sessions then joins.                                 |
| `dag-parallel`    | DAG with explicit `depends_on` edges.                                          |
| `pr-review`       | Review-only flow targeting a PR diff.                                          |
| `brainstorm`      | Explore ideas -> synthesize -> plan. Interactive ideation with human steering. |
| `conditional`     | Conditional routing -- branch based on review outcome, converge at PR.         |
| `docs`            | Lightweight docs flow: plan -> implement -> PR. No verify/review.              |
| `islc`            | Full ISLC loop (Intake, Spec, Landing, Close).                                 |
| `islc-quick`      | Condensed ISLC for small tickets.                                              |

### YAML structure

```yaml
name: default
description: Plan, audit, implement, verify, review, document, close
stages:
  - name: plan
    agent: spec-planner
    gate: manual # manual | auto | condition
  - name: audit
    agent: plan-auditor
    depends_on: [plan]
    gate: auto
  - name: implement
    agent: implementer
    depends_on: [audit]
    gate: auto
    verify:
      - "bun test"
      - "bun run lint"
    on_failure: "retry(3)" # fail-loopback: retry with error context injected
  - name: review
    agent: reviewer
    depends_on: [implement]
    gate: auto
  - name: document
    agent: documenter
    depends_on: [review]
    gate: auto
  - name: close
    agent: closer
    depends_on: [document]
    gate: auto
```

Key fields:

- `gate`: `manual` blocks until `ark session advance`, `auto` moves on when the agent reports completion, `condition` uses a predicate expression.
- `verify`: list of shell commands that must exit 0 before completion. Agents that report done while verify fails are steered back to fix it. Use `ark session complete --force` to bypass.
- `on_failure: retry(N)`: fail-loopback. Re-dispatches the stage with the failure context injected, up to N retries.
- `depends_on`: list of prior stage names for DAG ordering. Enables parallel execution of stages with no ordering constraint.
- `action`: replaces `agent` for non-LLM stages. Built-in actions: `create_pr` (push branch + `gh pr create`), `auto_merge` (wait for CI then merge).
- `edges`: explicit graph edges with `condition` expressions for conditional routing (see the `conditional` flow). Edges support `from`, `to`, `condition`, and `label` fields.
- `task`: per-stage task prompt override. Template variables (`{summary}`, `{repo}`, `{workdir}`) are substituted at dispatch.
- Fan-out stages wait for all their spawned children before the parent advances (auto-join on child completion).

```bash
ark flow list
ark flow show default
ark session start --flow dag-parallel --repo . --summary "..." --dispatch
```

## 4. Agents and Runtimes

Ark cleanly separates the role of an agent from the tool that runs it.

- **Agent** (role): what the agent does. System prompt, tools, skills, max turns, permission mode.
- **Runtime** (tool): how the agent runs. LLM backend, CLI command, model catalog, task delivery, billing mode.

At dispatch, agent config and runtime config are merged. Agent-level values take precedence over runtime defaults. You can override the runtime on the CLI with `--runtime`.

### Agents (13 builtin roles)

| Role                  | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ticket-intake`       | Parse tickets, extract requirements.                          |
| `spec-planner`        | Write the spec/plan.                                          |
| `plan-auditor`        | Audit a plan before implementation.                           |
| `planner`             | General planning role.                                        |
| `implementer`         | Write code for a spec.                                        |
| `task-implementer`    | Implement a single task (fan-out child).                      |
| `verifier`            | Run and interpret verification.                               |
| `reviewer`            | Structured code review (P0-P3 JSON output).                   |
| `documenter`          | Update docs.                                                  |
| `closer`              | Final checks, PR/merge.                                       |
| `retro`               | Post-session retrospective and learnings.                     |
| `worker`              | Generic task runner (fan-out child).                          |
| `goose-recipe-runner` | Runs a Goose recipe file passed via session inputs (goose-*). |

```bash
ark agent list
ark agent show implementer
```

### Agent YAML

```yaml
# agents/implementer.yaml
name: implementer
description: Implements a plan into working code
runtime: claude-code # default runtime; override with --runtime
model: sonnet # opus | sonnet | haiku (claude models)
max_turns: 200
system_prompt: |
  You are working on {repo} (branch {branch}).
  Ticket: {ticket}
  Task: {summary}
  Workdir: {workdir}
  Write minimal, correct code. Run tests before claiming done.
skills: [test-writing, self-review, sanity-gate]
tools: [Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebSearch]
permission_mode: bypassPermissions
env: {}
```

Template variables substituted at dispatch time: `{ticket}`, `{summary}`, `{repo}`, `{branch}`, `{workdir}`.

### Runtimes (6)

| Name           | Tool                              | Billing                     | Transcript parser                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `claude-code`  | Claude Code CLI                   | api (per token)             | claude                             |
| `claude-agent` | Anthropic Agent SDK (in-process)  | api (per token)             | agent-sdk                          |
| `claude-max`   | Claude Code (Max subscription)    | subscription ($200/mo flat) | claude                             |
| `codex`        | OpenAI Codex CLI                  | api                         | codex (default model: gpt-5-codex) |
| `gemini`       | Google Gemini CLI                 | api                         | gemini                             |
| `goose`        | Goose CLI (Block / LF AAIF)       | api                         | goose                              |

`claude-code` runs Claude Code as a CLI child process in tmux with hooks. `claude-agent` runs the Anthropic Agent SDK in-process (no CLI binary), which is faster on boot and supports gateway wire-format compatibility modes (e.g. Bedrock). The pre-rename names `claude` and `agent-sdk` are aliased for back-compat, so older session rows and agent YAMLs continue to resolve.

```bash
ark runtime list
ark runtime show codex

# Override runtime at dispatch time
ark session start --repo . --summary "Port module" \
  --agent implementer --runtime codex --dispatch

ark session start --repo . --summary "UI polish" \
  --agent worker --runtime gemini --dispatch

# Use Goose runtime
ark session start --repo . --summary "Add logging" \
  --agent worker --runtime goose --dispatch

# Use the in-process Agent SDK runtime
ark session start --repo . --summary "Fix lint errors" \
  --agent implementer --runtime claude-agent --dispatch

# Use Max subscription (zero per-token cost tracked, tokens still recorded)
ark session start --repo . --summary "Big refactor" \
  --agent implementer --runtime claude-max --dispatch
```

### Runtime YAML

```yaml
# runtimes/codex.yaml
name: codex
description: "OpenAI Codex CLI"
type: cli-agent # claude-code | claude-agent | cli-agent | goose | subprocess
command: ["codex", "--approval-mode", "full-auto"]
task_delivery: arg # stdin | file | arg
billing:
  mode: api # api | subscription | free
  transcript_parser: codex # selects CodexTranscriptParser
task_prompt: |
  When you finish, stop with a final assistant message that summarizes what you
  accomplished (files changed, tests added, key decisions).
```

Five executor types are registered at boot:

- `claude-code` -- launches Claude Code in tmux with hooks and an MCP channel.
- `claude-agent` -- runs the Anthropic Agent SDK in-process (no tmux, no CLI binary).
- `cli-agent` -- any other CLI tool in tmux, with worktree isolation.
- `goose` -- launches Goose in tmux with recipe-file task delivery.
- `subprocess` -- generic child process, no tmux.

Each executor implements 5 methods: `launch`, `kill`, `status`, `send`, `capture`.

---

## 5. Skills

Skills are reusable prompt fragments. They are YAML files whose `prompt` field is injected into an agent's system prompt when attached.

### Builtin skills (7)

| Skill             | Purpose                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `code-review`     | Structured review checklist.           |
| `plan-audit`      | Checks a plan against a spec.          |
| `sanity-gate`     | Quick sanity check before completion.  |
| `security-scan`   | Security-focused review.               |
| `self-review`     | Self-critique prior to reporting done. |
| `spec-extraction` | Extract requirements from a ticket.    |
| `test-writing`    | TDD guidance for writing tests.        |

### Three-tier resolution

Skills resolve in priority order:

1. Project: `.ark/skills/<name>.yaml` in the repo
2. Global: `~/.ark/skills/<name>.yaml`
3. Builtin: `skills/<name>.yaml` shipped with Ark

A project-level skill with the same name overrides a global or builtin one.

### Attaching to agents

```yaml
# agents/reviewer.yaml
name: reviewer
runtime: claude
skills: [code-review, security-scan, self-review]
```

At dispatch, each listed skill's `prompt` field is inlined into the agent's system prompt.

### CLI

```bash
ark skill list
ark skill show code-review
```

---

## 6. Recipes

Recipes are session templates with variables. They let you quick-launch a common configuration.

### Builtin recipes (10)

| Recipe          | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quick-fix`     | Small bug fix with minimal flow.                               |
| `fix-bug`       | Bug fix with audit and review.                                 |
| `feature-build` | Full feature development loop.                                 |
| `new-feature`   | Alias for feature-build with different defaults.               |
| `code-review`   | Review-only session targeting an existing branch/PR.           |
| `ideate`        | Brainstorming and spec drafting.                               |
| `islc`          | Full ISLC (Intake/Spec/Landing/Close) pipeline.                |
| `islc-quick`    | Shortened ISLC.                                                |
| `self-dogfood`  | Use Ark to work on Ark itself (autonomous-sdlc flow, auto-PR). |
| `self-quick`    | Quick single-agent dispatch against the Ark repo.              |

### CLI

```bash
ark recipe list
ark recipe show quick-fix
ark session start --recipe quick-fix --repo . \
  --summary "Fix off-by-one in pager" --dispatch
```

### Creating a recipe from an existing session

```bash
ark recipe from-session <sessionId> --name my-recipe --save
```

Recipes resolve three-tier like skills: `.ark/recipes/` > `~/.ark/recipes/` > `recipes/`.

---

## 7. Compute

Ark supports 11 compute providers across four isolation modes. Each provider launches an agent either directly (local) or via the universal `arkd` daemon on the remote target.

### Provider matrix

| Mode            | Provider           | Isolation                | When to use                     |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Local           | `local`            | None (git worktree only) | Fastest, trusted code.          |
| Local isolated  | `docker`           | Docker container         | Isolate deps from host.         |
| Local isolated  | `devcontainer`     | VS Code devcontainer     | Reuse existing devcontainer.    |
| Local isolated  | `firecracker`      | Firecracker micro-VM     | Strong isolation on a laptop.   |
| Remote via arkd | `ec2`              | EC2 instance + arkd      | Offload compute to cloud.       |
| Remote via arkd | `ec2-docker`       | EC2 + docker-in-docker   | Cloud plus container isolation. |
| Remote via arkd | `ec2-devcontainer` | EC2 + devcontainer       | Cloud devcontainer.             |
| Remote via arkd | `ec2-firecracker`  | EC2 + Firecracker        | Cloud plus VM isolation.        |
| Managed         | `e2b`              | E2B managed sandbox      | Hands-off managed sandbox.      |
| Cluster         | `k8s`              | Kubernetes Pod           | Existing k8s fleet.             |
| Cluster         | `k8s-kata`         | K8s with Kata VM runtime | Hardware-isolated pods.         |

Remote providers all run the `arkd` daemon on port 19300. The daemon is stateless and handles agent lifecycle, file ops, metrics, channel relay, and the `/codegraph/index` endpoint for remote knowledge indexing.

### Isolation guidance

- `local`: fastest, no sandbox. Only for code you trust and day-to-day work on your own machine.
- `docker` / `devcontainer`: dependency isolation without VM overhead. Good default for CI-like runs.
- `firecracker` / `ec2-firecracker` / `k8s-kata`: VM-grade isolation for untrusted input, multi-tenant, or regulated workloads.
- `ec2-*`: offload compute, free up your laptop, share big instances across sessions.
- `e2b`: managed sandbox with no ops overhead.

### CLI

```bash
ark compute list
ark compute show <id>
ark compute create --provider docker --name my-sandbox
ark compute create --provider ec2-firecracker --region us-west-2
ark compute start <id>
ark compute stop <id>
ark compute clean <id>
ark compute delete <id>
```

### Selecting a compute at dispatch

```bash
ark session start --repo . --summary "..." --compute docker --dispatch
ark session start --repo . --summary "..." --compute ec2-firecracker --dispatch
```

If no compute is specified, the session uses the `default_compute` field from `~/.ark/config.yaml`, falling back to `local`.

---

## 8. Compute Templates

Compute templates are named presets in `~/.ark/config.yaml`. They let you define a one-line name instead of re-typing provider and config every time.

### Define in config

```yaml
# ~/.ark/config.yaml
compute_templates:
  fast-local:
    provider: docker
    config:
      image: ark/sandbox:latest
      memory_gb: 8
      cpus: 4
  heavy-cloud:
    provider: ec2-firecracker
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      instance_type: c6a.4xlarge
      vcpus: 16
      memory_gb: 32
  review-sandbox:
    provider: e2b
    config:
      template: ark-sandbox
```

### CLI

```bash
ark compute template list
ark compute template show fast-local
ark compute template create heavy-cloud \
  --provider ec2-firecracker \
  --config '{"region":"us-west-2"}'
ark compute template delete fast-local

# Use at compute creation time
ark compute create --from-template heavy-cloud

# Or directly at session dispatch
ark session start --repo . --summary "..." \
  --compute-template heavy-cloud --dispatch
```

Compute templates are tenant-scoped in hosted mode and stored in the `compute_templates` table.

---

## 9. Knowledge Graph

Ark has a unified knowledge graph that stores codebase structure, session history, memories, learnings, skills, recipes, and agents -- all as nodes and edges in SQLite (or Postgres in hosted mode). The tables are `knowledge` and `knowledge_edges`, tenant-scoped.

### Indexer: ops-codegraph

The indexer is [@optave/codegraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@optave/codegraph) -- a TypeScript plus native Rust engine using tree-sitter WASM. It supports 33 languages out of the box and does not require Python.

```bash
npm install -g @optave/codegraph
# or let Ark pick it up as a local npm dependency
```

Ark reads `.codegraph/graph.db` after indexing and maps nodes and edges into its own `knowledge` table. A git co-change pass then adds co-modification edges.

### Auto-index on dispatch

- **Local compute**: honors `knowledge.auto_index` in `~/.ark/config.yaml`. Skip entirely with `auto_index: false`.
- **Remote compute**: always indexes via the arkd `/codegraph/index` endpoint. There is no way to skip it remotely -- the remote filesystem is the only place the indexer can see the code.

```yaml
# ~/.ark/config.yaml
knowledge:
  auto_index: true # local dispatches index the repo
  incremental_index: true # only re-index changed files
```

### MCP tools for agents

When an agent runs, it gets 6 MCP tools against the knowledge store:

| Tool                 | Purpose                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `knowledge/search`   | Full-text search over nodes (files, symbols, sessions, memories). |
| `knowledge/context`  | Build a token-budgeted context bundle for a question.             |
| `knowledge/impact`   | Find impact/blast radius of changing a file or symbol.            |
| `knowledge/history`  | Session and edit history for a file.                              |
| `knowledge/remember` | Save a memory node.                                               |
| `knowledge/recall`   | Retrieve memories (by query or label).                            |

### Context injection at dispatch

At dispatch time, Ark builds a token-budgeted context bundle from the knowledge graph (max around 2000 tokens) and injects it into the agent's system prompt. This gives the agent immediate situational awareness without inflating the prompt.

### CLI

```bash
ark knowledge search "auth middleware"
ark knowledge index <repo>
ark knowledge stats
ark knowledge remember "Router port is 8430" --tags router,ports
ark knowledge recall "router port"
ark knowledge ingest <path>
ark knowledge export --out ~/notes
ark knowledge import ~/notes
```

---

## 10. Cost Tracking

Ark has universal cost tracking across every runtime. Every LLM call is recorded via a transcript parser or router callback, priced through a local registry, and written to the `usage_records` table.

### Components

- **PricingRegistry** -- 300+ models with per-token prices, loaded from the LiteLLM public JSON. Lazy-refreshed.
- **UsageRecorder** -- appends rows to `usage_records` with input/output tokens, cost, session, user, tenant, model, provider, runtime, agent.
- **TranscriptParserRegistry** -- polymorphic parsers per runtime.

Per-runtime transcript parsers:

| Parser                   | Location                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ClaudeTranscriptParser` | `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl` (exact path resolved from session id) |
| `CodexTranscriptParser`  | `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` (matched by cwd)                   |
| `GeminiTranscriptParser` | `~/.gemini/tmp/<slug>/chats/session-*.jsonl` (matched by projectHash)             |

### cost_mode column

Each usage row has a `cost_mode`:

| Mode           | Meaning                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api`          | Per-token cost from PricingRegistry.                                             |
| `subscription` | Flat-rate plan -- `cost_usd = 0`, tokens still recorded for rate-limit tracking. |
| `free`         | `cost_usd = 0`.                                                                  |

`claude-max` is the canonical subscription runtime (Claude Max $200/month). Its tokens feed dashboards but never add to the cost ledger.

### CLI

```bash
ark costs                       # summary with charts
ark costs --session <id>
ark costs --tenant acme
ark costs --by model
ark costs --by runtime
ark costs --by agent
ark costs --since 7d
ark costs-sync                  # rescan transcripts and fill gaps
ark costs-export --format csv --out costs.csv
```

Attribution works across session, user, tenant, model, provider, runtime, and agent dimensions.

### Budgets

Set daily, weekly, and monthly limits in `~/.ark/config.yaml`. When a limit is hit, new dispatches are blocked until the window rolls over (admins can override).

```yaml
budgets:
  daily_usd: 25
  weekly_usd: 100
  monthly_usd: 300
  warn_at_percent: 80
```

---

## 11. LLM Router

The LLM Router (`packages/router/`) is an OpenAI-compatible HTTP proxy that routes requests across providers with policies, circuit breakers, and an optional TensorZero backend.

### Policies

| Policy     | Behavior                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `quality`  | Prefer the best model for each request class. |
| `balanced` | Trade off cost and quality. Default.          |
| `cost`     | Minimize cost.                                |

Each request is classified (complexity, length, tool calls) and routed to an appropriate model tier. Circuit breakers track per-provider failure rates and fail over to the next provider automatically. Cascade mode retries progressively stronger models on failure. Per-provider adapters normalize the request and response shape.

### TensorZero backend (optional)

TensorZero is an open-source Rust LLM gateway (Apache 2.0). When enabled, Ark generates a `tensorzero.toml` from your API keys and starts TensorZero in one of three modes:

1. Detect an existing sidecar on the configured port.
2. Start the native TensorZero binary if installed.
3. Fall back to Docker.

`packages/core/router/tensorzero.ts` is the lifecycle manager. Auto-start happens on boot when both `router.auto_start` and `tensorzero.enabled` are true.

### Injection into executors

When the router is enabled, executors inject `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (and provider variants) into the agent's environment. Every LLM call from the agent then flows: Agent -> Router -> (TensorZero) -> Provider. An `onUsage` callback feeds the `UsageRecorder`.

### Config

```yaml
# ~/.ark/config.yaml
router:
  enabled: true
  url: http://localhost:8430
  policy: balanced
  auto_start: true

tensorzero:
  enabled: true
  port: 3000
  config_dir: ~/.ark/tensorzero
  auto_start: true
```

### CLI

```bash
ark router start --port 8430 --policy balanced
ark router status
ark router costs
```

---

## 12. Auth and Multi-Tenancy

Ark is multi-tenant from the ground up. All entities are tenant-scoped: sessions, compute, events, messages, todos, groups, schedules, compute pools, compute templates, usage records, resource definitions, knowledge, knowledge edges.

### API keys

Format: `ark_<tenantId>_<secret>`. Example: `ark_acme_9f8a7b...`.

```bash
ark auth key create --tenant acme --role admin --label "CI key"
ark auth key list
ark auth key revoke <keyId>
ark auth key rotate <keyId>
```

### Roles

| Role     | Permissions                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `admin`  | Full access, manage keys, set policies.    |
| `member` | Start/stop sessions, read all tenant data. |
| `viewer` | Read-only.                                 |

### Tenant policies

`TenantPolicyManager` enforces per-tenant rules:

```yaml
# applied via `ark tenant policy set --tenant acme --file policy.yaml`
allowed_providers: [local, docker, ec2-firecracker]
default_provider: docker
max_concurrent_sessions: 20
daily_cost_cap_usd: 200
compute_pools: [pool-fast, pool-gpu]

# integration enforcement
router_required: true
auto_index_required: true
router_policy: balanced
tensorzero_enabled: true
```

When `router_required` is on, dispatches fail unless the router is up. `auto_index_required` forces knowledge indexing for every dispatch (local and remote). `router_policy` locks the router policy for the tenant. `tensorzero_enabled` requires TensorZero to be the active backend.

### Sessions have user_id

Every session carries both `tenant_id` and `user_id`. Cost attribution, quotas, and audit all work per-user within a tenant.

### Tenant-scoped app context

```ts
const appAcme = app.forTenant("acme");
appAcme.sessions.list(); // only acme sessions
appAcme.computes.list(); // only acme compute
appAcme.knowledge.search("auth middleware"); // only acme knowledge
```

---

## 13. Git Worktrees

Every session gets its own git worktree at `~/.ark/worktrees/<sessionId>/` on a branch named after the session. This keeps work isolated and reviewable.

### Workflow

```bash
# Dispatch creates the worktree automatically
ark session start --repo . --summary "..." --dispatch

# See a diff stat
ark worktree diff <sessionId>

# Finish the session: merge or open a PR
ark worktree finish <sessionId>      # interactive: merge, PR, or discard
ark worktree merge <sessionId>       # merge into base branch
ark worktree pr <sessionId>          # push and create a PR via `gh`
```

The web dashboard shows a diff preview per session, with a "Finish" action that triggers the same merge/PR flow.

### Auto-PR

When an agent completes and the repo has a git remote, Ark auto-pushes the branch and creates a PR via `gh pr create`. Disable per-repo with `auto_pr: false` in `.ark.yaml`.

---

## 14. Search

Ark ships a FTS5 full-text search index across sessions, events, messages, and Claude Code transcripts.

```bash
ark search "race condition in scheduler"
ark search "auth middleware" --transcripts   # also scan ~/.claude/projects JSONL
ark search "pager bug" --index               # rebuild the FTS5 index
ark index                                    # alias for --index
```

Search uses FTS5 when the `transcript_index` virtual table exists, and falls back to file scanning only when the table is absent. If you see unexpectedly empty results on an existing DB, run `ark index` to build the FTS table.

---

## 15. Dashboards (CLI, Web, Desktop)

Ark has three UI surfaces. Surface parity is a hard rule -- every feature that exists in one surface must exist in the others.

### CLI

```bash
ark dashboard           # top-like summary dashboard
ark session list
ark session events <id>
ark costs
ark compute list
```

Twenty-four command modules cover sessions, compute, flows, skills, recipes, agents, runtimes, auth, router, knowledge, search, worktree, costs, conductor, daemon, dashboard, eval, memory, misc, profile, schedule, server, server-daemon, and tenant.

### Web

```bash
ark web                 # starts Vite dev server + auto-starts daemon
ark web --with-daemon   # explicit: starts conductor (:19100) + arkd (:19300) in-process
make web-build          # production build
```

Vite + React + shadcn/ui with a custom design system (theme tokens, component library). Pages: Dashboard, Sessions, Agents, Flows, Compute, History, Memory, Tools, Schedules, Costs, Settings.

Key web features (v0.18):

- **Pipeline visualization**: interactive DAG viewer using @xyflow/react + d3-dag. Each flow stage is a draggable node with live status. Click a stage to see details, logs, and tool calls.
- **Session replay**: step through a completed session event-by-event with elapsed timestamps, stage transitions, and expandable detail panels.
- **Rich task input**: markdown toolbar, file attachments, issue references. Cmd+Enter to start a session, Esc to cancel.
- **Deep links**: `/sessions/<id>`, `/agents/<name>`, `/flows/<name>` with tab support (`?tab=conversation`).
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Cmd+K opens the command palette, single-key navigation (D=Dashboard, S=Sessions, A=Agents, F=Flows, C=Compute, H=History, M=Memory).
- **Unread badges**: sessions with new messages show a red dot in the sidebar and session list.
- **Compute detail drawer**: click a process, container, or tmux session for full details and live system metrics.
- **SSE live updates**: real-time event streaming, Recharts cost charts, conversation messages with typing indicators.

The `--with-daemon` flag starts the conductor and arkd in-process so you get a fully working instance with a single command. If daemons are already running on those ports, Ark detects them via a `/health` probe and reuses them.

### Desktop

The Electron desktop app wraps the web dashboard with native window chrome and auto-starts all daemons on launch -- zero configuration needed.

```bash
make desktop            # launches Electron wrapper (dev)
make desktop-build      # packages for distribution
```

As of v0.17, the desktop app is **fully self-contained** -- it bundles the `ark-native` binary inside the installer. Users download, install, and launch with no separate CLI install required. On first launch (macOS), a dialog offers to create a `/usr/local/bin/ark` symlink for terminal access.

See [packages/desktop/INSTALL.md](../packages/desktop/INSTALL.md) for platform-specific install instructions and the macOS Gatekeeper workaround for the unsigned build.

---

## 16. Knowledge Export and Import

Memories and learnings live in the knowledge graph, not in plain files. Ark provides a portable markdown format for backup, sharing, and cross-machine sync.

```bash
# Export all memories and learnings as markdown files
ark knowledge export --out ~/notes/ark

# Directory layout: one .md file per memory, YAML front matter for metadata
# ~/notes/ark/memory-<id>.md
# ---
# id: mem_01
# tags: [router, ports]
# created: 2026-04-01
# ---
# Router port is 8430

# Import back (idempotent by id)
ark knowledge import ~/notes/ark
```

Export and import are tenant-scoped in hosted mode. The old `~/.ark/memories.json` and `~/.ark/LEARNINGS.md` files are no longer used -- memories are nodes in the knowledge graph.

---

## 17. MCP Integration

Ark ships stub MCP server configs for four vendors: Atlassian (Jira/Confluence), GitHub, Linear, and Figma. These live in `mcp-configs/` and get merged into the agent's MCP server list at dispatch.

```bash
ls mcp-configs/
# atlassian.json  figma.json  github.json  linear.json
```

### MCP socket pooling

Spawning one MCP server process per agent is memory-expensive. Ark pools MCP server sockets and shares a single server process across agents on the same compute target. In measurements this drops memory use by 85-90 percent compared to per-agent spawning.

The pool is transparent -- agents see a normal MCP server and Ark routes requests through the shared socket.

---

## 18. Remote Client Mode

The CLI and Web can connect to a remote Ark server instead of running locally. They open a WebSocket `ArkClient` and delegate every operation.

```bash
# Env vars
export ARK_SERVER=https://ark.company.com
export ARK_TOKEN=ark_default_9f8a7b...

ark session list
ark web

# Or pass flags explicitly
ark --server https://ark.company.com --token ark_default_xxx session list
ark --server https://ark.company.com --token ark_default_xxx web
```

When remote mode is active, the CLI does not boot a local AppContext -- all state lives on the server.

---

## 19. Control Plane (Hosted Mode)

`ark server start --hosted` boots Ark as a multi-tenant control plane.

### What changes in hosted mode

| Subsystem       | Local mode                           | Hosted mode                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database        | SQLite (`~/.ark/ark.db`)             | Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`)                                   |
| Resource stores | File-backed (`~/.ark/skills/`, etc.) | DB-backed (`DbResourceStore`, `resource_definitions` table) |
| SSE bus         | In-memory                            | Redis (`REDIS_URL`)                                         |
| Auth            | Not enforced                         | API keys required                                           |
| Workers         | Single machine                       | Worker registry + scheduler                                 |
| Tenants         | Single `default` tenant              | Multi-tenant with policies                                  |

### Worker registry and scheduler

Workers register with the control plane via HTTP. The registry health-checks them every 60s and prunes stale workers after 90s. The session scheduler assigns new sessions to available workers, respecting tenant policies (allowed providers, max concurrency, cost caps, compute pools).

### Start

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://ark:secret@localhost:5432/ark \
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 \
ark server start --hosted --port 19100
```

### Tenant setup

```bash
ark tenant create acme --name "Acme Corp"
ark auth key create --tenant acme --role admin --label "bootstrap"
ark tenant policy set --tenant acme --file policy.yaml
```

---

## 20. Deployment

### Dockerfile

The single Dockerfile in `.infra/Dockerfile` builds a bun-based image containing Ark, tmux, git, and the `gh` CLI. It is used for both the control plane and workers.

```bash
docker build -f .infra/Dockerfile -t ark:latest .
docker run --rm -it -p 19100:19100 ark:latest ark server start --hosted
```

### docker-compose

`docker-compose.yaml` in `.infra/` brings up the full hosted stack.

```yaml
services:
  ark: # control plane (:19100)
  postgres: # hosted DB
  redis: # SSE bus
  tensorzero: # optional LLM gateway
  worker-1: # arkd worker
  worker-2: # arkd worker
```

```bash
cd .infra && docker compose up -d
```

Ark auto-creates tables, starts the router and TensorZero (if enabled), and registers workers.

### Helm chart

`.infra/helm/ark/` is a production Helm chart with:

- Separate deployments for control plane and workers
- Postgres and Redis sub-charts (or external via values)
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler on the scheduler
- Kata Containers runtime class for `k8s-kata` sessions
- Firecracker support via a privileged daemonset
- Ingress with TLS

```bash
helm install ark .infra/helm/ark \
  --set postgres.external=true \
  --set postgres.url=postgres://... \
  --set redis.external=true \
  --set redis.url=redis://... \
  --set router.enabled=true \
  --set tensorzero.enabled=true
```

### Environment variables

| Variable             | Default                  | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ARK_CONDUCTOR_PORT` | `19100`                  | Conductor HTTP port.                        |
| `ARK_CONDUCTOR_URL`  | `http://localhost:19100` | Conductor URL for channels.                 |
| `ARK_ARKD_URL`       | `http://localhost:19300` | arkd daemon URL.                            |
| `ARK_ARKD_PORT`      | `19300`                  | arkd daemon port.                           |
| `ARK_CHANNEL_PORT`   | auto                     | Per-session MCP channel port.               |
| `ARK_SERVER`         | -                        | Remote Ark server URL (remote client mode). |
| `ARK_TOKEN`          | -                        | API key for remote server.                  |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | -                        | Postgres URL (hosted mode).                 |
| `REDIS_URL`          | -                        | Redis URL (hosted SSE bus).                 |
| `ARK_TEST_DIR`       | -                        | Temp dir for test isolation.                |

---

## 21. Daemon Architecture

Ark uses a daemon-client architecture. The server daemon runs on port 19400 and manages all state. The web dashboard and desktop app connect as thin WebSocket clients -- they do not run an in-process AppContext.

### Managing the daemon

```bash
ark conductor start        # start the arkd agent daemon (port 19300)
ark conductor stop         # stop a running daemon
ark conductor status       # check if the daemon is running
```

### Auto-start with web and desktop

`ark web --with-daemon` starts the conductor (:19100) and arkd (:19300) in-process alongside the web server. The desktop app does this by default, so launching Ark Desktop gives you a fully working instance with no manual daemon management.

If the daemon is already running on those ports, both `ark web` and the desktop app detect it via a `/health` probe and reuse it instead of starting a second instance.

### Port summary

| Port  | Service                   |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 8420  | Web dashboard (Vite)      |
| 19100 | Conductor (HTTP)          |
| 19300 | arkd agent daemon         |
| 19400 | Server daemon (WebSocket) |

---

## 22. Messaging Bridges

Ark can send notifications to Telegram, Slack, and Discord when session events occur (stage completion, failures, etc.).

### Configuration

Create `~/.ark/bridge.json`:

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "botToken": "123456:ABC-DEF...",
    "chatId": "-1001234567890"
  },
  "slack": {
    "webhookUrl": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../..."
  },
  "discord": {
    "webhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
  }
}
```

You can configure one, two, or all three. Notifications fire on stage completion, session errors, and other lifecycle events.

---

## 23. Profiles

Profiles let you save and switch between named sets of UI preferences and settings.

```bash
ark profile list        # list available profiles
ark profile create dev  # create a new profile
ark profile delete dev  # delete a profile
```

Profiles are stored in `~/.ark/profiles.json`.

---

## 24. Schedules

Schedules let you run sessions on a cron schedule -- recurring tasks like nightly builds, daily reviews, or periodic maintenance.

```bash
# Create a recurring schedule
ark schedule add \
  --cron "0 9 * * *" \
  --recipe quick-fix \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --summary "Daily lint check"

# Manage schedules
ark schedule list
ark schedule enable <id>
ark schedule disable <id>
ark schedule delete <id>
```

The web dashboard also has a Schedules page with full CRUD for managing recurring sessions visually.

# Check prerequisites
ark doctor

# Initialize Ark for a repo
ark init

# Start a quick fix session
ark session start --recipe quick-fix --repo . --summary "..." --dispatch

  --summary "Add SSO" --compute ec2-firecracker --dispatch

# Fully autonomous SDLC: plan -> implement -> verify -> review -> PR
ark session start --flow autonomous-sdlc --repo . \
  --summary "Add health-check endpoint" --dispatch

# Fan-out 4 children for independent subtasks
ark session fork <parentId> --count 4 --summaries "a,b,c,d"

# Swap runtime to Codex for one session
ark session start --repo . --summary "Refactor parser" \
  --agent implementer --runtime codex --dispatch

# Use Goose runtime
ark session start --repo . --summary "Add logging" \
  --agent worker --runtime goose --dispatch

# Use Max subscription (no per-token cost)
ark session start --repo . --summary "Long refactor" \
  --agent implementer --runtime claude-max --dispatch

# Start/stop the daemon
ark conductor start
ark conductor status

# Schedule a recurring session
ark schedule add --cron "0 9 * * *" --recipe quick-fix \
  --repo . --summary "Daily lint check"

# Inspect costs
ark costs --by runtime --since 7d
ark costs-export --format csv --out last-week.csv

# Check router health
ark router status

# Connect to a hosted server
ark --server https://ark.company.com --token ark_default_xxx web

That is the full tour. Every concept is documented here: sessions (with replay), 14 flows (including autonomous-sdlc and conditional routing), 13 agents, 6 runtimes (Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, Claude Max, Codex, Gemini, Goose), skills, 10 recipes, all 11 compute providers, compute templates, the ops-codegraph knowledge graph, universal cost tracking with cost modes, the LLM router with optional TensorZero backend, multi-tenant auth, git worktrees, search, dashboards across CLI/Web/Desktop (with pipeline visualization, deep links, and keyboard shortcuts), knowledge export/import, MCP integration with socket pooling, remote client mode, the hosted control plane, deployment via Dockerfile/docker-compose/Helm, daemon architecture, messaging bridges (Telegram/Slack/Discord), profiles, schedules, and CLI utilities.
